== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is this plugin for? =

For anyone who needs a map on their site in 5 seconds.

= Google Map shows the wrong location =

Write the address differently, or more precisely. Make sure you enter the street, town and country name. If necessary enter lat/lng coordinates instead of the address. Use the numeric notation, eg: "40.7127, 74.0059"

= How to generate the API key =

We understand that creating a Google Maps API key is frustrating but it takes less than a minute and it's something Google requires.
Follow <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_embed_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE&reusekey=true" target="_blank">wizard step #1</a> - login with any Gmail account, click next/confirm a few times with the default settings &amp; copy the Google Maps API key you see on the screen; it's the key you need. Then use <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=static_maps_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE&reusekey=true" target="_blank">wizard step #2</a>, select the same "My Project" project from the list and that's it. Save the key in Maps Widget for Google Maps settings.
If you want to protect your API key by using the "Accept requests from these HTTP referrers (web sites)" option in Google Console make sure to add your domain in these two formats: `*.mydomain.com/*` and `mydomain.com/*` and wait a few minutes until Google makes the necessary changes.
If that didn't help read our detailed guide on <a href="https://www.gmapswidget.com/documentation/generate-google-maps-api-key/">how to create a Google Maps API key</a>.

= Google map thumbnail works but lightbox won't open on click =

You probably have Fancybox JS and CSS files included twice; once by the theme and second time by Maps Widget for Google Maps plugin. Remove one instance of files. If that's not the case then you have a fatal JS error that's preventing execution of other JS code. Hit F12 in Firefox or Chrome and have a look at the debug console. If there are any red lines - it's a fatal error.

= The Google map is not working!!! Arrrrrrrrr =

Open a new thread in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/google-maps-widget">support forums</a> but please bear in mind that support is community based and we do this in our spare time.

= How do I get Maps Widget for Google Maps Pro? =

Simply visit <a href="https://www.gmapswidget.com">gmapswidget.com</a> and purchase the GMW PRO. Yearly and lifetime licenses are available.

= I've installed the plugin, now what? =

In WordPress admin open Appearance - Widgets and add a Maps Widget for Google Maps to a sidebar. And make sure you follow instructions on how to generate a Google Maps API key. Without it maps won't work.

= How do I put a Google map on my page/post? =

In order to show your Google map in your page or post, simply copy the shortcode supplied and paste it into your page or post. This feature is available only in GMW PRO.

= I want to use Google Maps but don't have WordPress =

Try <a href="http://www.niftymaps.co">Nifty Maps</a> - a comprehensive Map Builder for any website
